# Algorithmic Design Notebook of the Gymnastics Pavilion in Moscow.

The project presented in this collection of notebooks is an adaptation of the Irina Viner-Usmanova Rhythmic Gymnastics Centre, originally designed by CPU Pride for Moscow, Russia. The program elaborated here is a personal interpretation of the original design, developed in a 5 day collaborative sprint. This notebook uses the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and the Khepri algorithmic design tool to model the building's geometry.
This project was developed simultaneously in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and in [Pluto]( https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). Given the nature of the tools, the two notebooks show different representations of the project.

__Jupyter Narrative:__
The Jupyter notebook describes the creative process behind the development of the program, showcasing the programâ€™s history and the various development paths followed along the way. Currently, the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) viewer for Jupyter does not have a Julia Kernel available online. To run this notebook interactively you must install IJulia on your PC. Use the saved screenshots to confirm that the notebook is yielding the expected results. Alternatively, you may just browse through a static version of the notebook on Binder ([here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KhepriNotebook/GymnasticsPavilion_Moscow/blob/master/GymPav.ipynb)) or here on GitHub by opening the [GymPav.ipynb](https://github.com/KhepriNotebook/GymnasticsPavilion_Moscow/blob/master/GymPav.ipynb) file.

__Pluto Summary:__
The Pluto notebook presents a summary version of the process, containing only the necessary definitions to generate the final version of the model. It does, however, document each one visually to aid the comprehension of the notebook. To run this notebook, install Pluto on your PC and open the [GymPav_Pluto.jl](https://github.com/KhepriNotebook/GymnasticsPavilion_Moscow/blob/master/GymPav_Pluto.jl) file. Use the saved screenshots to confirm that the notebook is yielding the expected results. There is yet no dedicated online viewer for Pluto notebooks. Hence, alternatively, you may just browse through the final version of the notebook saved in the [GymPav_Pluto.pdf](https://github.com/KhepriNotebook/GymnasticsPavilion_Moscow/blob/master/GymPav_Pluto.pdf) file.
